# Psitegrad's Infinite Backpack for Made in Abyss BSFD  

Massively increase the backpack capacity.  
This mod was made following a request.


### Description

This mod will bring your Backpack Capacity to 100.000.0000g or 100t. You can now pick the abyss clean !  

Please keep in mind that the backpack capacity only updates when acquiring a skill which upgrades its capacity.  
This is a game limitations for which we haven't found a remedy yet.  
In other words, even if you install the mod you will keep your current capacity until you get one of the "**Backpack UP**" skills.  
This also means that if you have an endgame character with maxed out backpack skills, you won't be able to use this mod, sorry ðŸ˜¦  

Removing this mod will not cause issues, your backpack capacity will however stay the same until the next skill is acquired.  

There are 4 scenarios that could unfold when you acquire your next skill:  
+ You no longer have the mod, in which case you'll return to having vanilla backpack capacity.
+ You still have the mod, in which case, your backapck capacity will not change.
+ You have switched to TYPE's mod, in which case you backpack capacity will be modified to their mod's value but not return to vanilla.
+ You have reached the end of the skill tree, in which case, your backpack capacity will remain as is with currently no means of changing it.

### Compatibility

Will conflict with any mods that edit the DT_SkillInfomation file.  
Currently conflicts with TYPE's [Bag maximum weight UP mod](https://game-4.tistory.com/22)  
I highly recommend TYPE's mod if you want a more balanced experience.
